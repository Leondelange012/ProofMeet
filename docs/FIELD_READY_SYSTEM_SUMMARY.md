## System Behavior

### Automatic Processes (No Manual Intervention Needed)

1. **Attendance Tracking** 🤖
   - Tracks join/leave times during Zoom meetings
   - Monitors camera on/off status
   - Calculates active vs. idle time
   - Determines meeting completion percentage

2. **Validation** 🤖
   - Automatically validates attendance after meeting ends
   - Checks: 80%+ attendance, 80%+ active time, 20% max idle time
   - Sets status: VALID, NEEDS_ATTENTION, or PENDING

3. **Court Card Generation** 🤖
   - Generates court card immediately after meeting validation
   - Creates unique card number
   - Generates verification URL
   - Creates QR code image

4. **Data Synchronization** 🤖
   - Backend processes run continuously
   - Database updates in real-time
   - Frontend can sync on-demand with "Sync Latest Data" button

### Manual Processes (Require User Action)

1. **Participant Signing** 👤
   - Participant must sign their own court card
   - Uses password authentication
   - Confirms with "I certify this attendance"

2. **Host Signing** 🤝
   - Host receives email with signature link
   - Reviews attendance details
   - Confirms and signs via unique URL

3. **Court Rep Review** 👁️
   - Optional: Court Rep can review court cards
   - Can download and verify all information
   - Can approve/reject if needed
