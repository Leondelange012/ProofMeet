## 🔧 Technical Decisions Made

### Architecture
- **Dual user types** instead of roles for clarity
- **JWT tokens** instead of session-based auth
- **Email domain verification** for Court Reps
- **Prisma ORM** for database operations
- **TypeScript** throughout for type safety

### Security
- **bcrypt** for password hashing (12 rounds)
- **JWT** with 7-day expiration
- **Email verification** before login (bypassable in dev)
- **Rate limiting** on all endpoints
- **Helmet** for security headers
- **CORS** configuration for production

### Development Workflow
- **V2 routes** as primary (`/api/auth`)
- **V1 routes** available at (`/api/v1/*`) for backward compatibility
- **Migration script** for data conversion
- **Seed script** for test data
- **Test script** for verification

---

## 📦 Dependencies Added

### Production
- `bcryptjs` - Password hashing
- `jsonwebtoken` - JWT tokens
- `express-validator` - Input validation
- `helmet` - Security headers
- `compression` - Response compression
- `express-rate-limit` - Rate limiting
- `dotenv` - Environment variables
- `qrcode` - QR code generation
- `winston` - Logging

### Development
- `typescript` - Type safety
- `tsx` - TypeScript execution
- `@types/*` - Type definitions
- `jest` - Testing framework
- `ts-jest` - TypeScript testing

---

## 🐛 Known Issues

### Minor
- [ ] Email verification not integrated with SendGrid yet (mocked)
- [ ] No password reset functionality yet
- [ ] No refresh token implementation yet

### To Be Addressed
- [ ] Add rate limiting per user (currently per IP)
- [ ] Add password strength requirements UI feedback
- [ ] Add account lockout after failed attempts
- [ ] Add audit logging for all actions

## 📝 Notes for Team

### Environment Setup
```bash
# Backend
cd backend
npm install
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with DATABASE_URL

# Generate Prisma client
npx prisma generate

# Run migrations
npx prisma migrate dev --name init_v2

# Seed database
npm run seed

# Start server
npm run dev
```

### Test Accounts Created
- **Court Rep**: `test.officer@probation.ca.gov` / `Test123!`
- **Participant**: `test.participant@example.com` / `Test123!`

### Testing Authentication
```bash
# Run test script
cd backend
./test-auth-v2.sh

# Or test manually
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/auth/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email":"test.officer@probation.ca.gov","password":"Test123!"}'
```

## 🚀 Deployment Status

### Current Environment
- **Development**: Local (http://localhost:5000)
- **Staging**: Not deployed yet
- **Production**: Phase 1 still running

### Deployment Plan
- Week 7: Deploy to staging environment

## 💡 Lessons Learned

1. **Prisma migrations are powerful** - Easy to version control schema changes
2. **Type safety catches bugs early** - TypeScript prevents many runtime errors
3. **Good documentation speeds development** - Clear specs make implementation straightforward
4. **Test scripts save time** - Automated testing catches issues immediately
5. **Modular architecture** - Easy to add features without breaking existing code
