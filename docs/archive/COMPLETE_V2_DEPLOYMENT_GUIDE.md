## 🐛 If Something Doesn't Work

### Check Backend:
```bash
curl https://proofmeet-backend-production.up.railway.app/health
```
Should show: `"version": "2.0.0"`

### Check Frontend:
- Visit: https://proof-meet-frontend.vercel.app
- Open browser console (F12)
- Look for API errors
- Check Network tab for failed requests

### Common Issues:

**1. Can't register Court Rep - "Email domain not approved"**
- Use: `yourname@test.proofmeet.com`
- Or run: `railway run npm run seed` (adds approved domains)

**2. Can't register Participant - "Court Rep not found"**
- Register Court Rep first
- Use exact Court Rep email in participant form

**3. Dashboard shows no data**
- Data loads from backend
- Check browser console for API errors
- Verify backend is running V2.0
