**Lines Added**: 1,849  
**Deployment Status**: ✅ Live on Railway (backend) and Vercel (frontend)

## 📦 What Was Implemented

### 1. ✅ **AI-Powered Engagement Detection**
**Service**: `backend/src/services/engagementDetection.ts`

**What it does:**
- Analyzes participant behavior during meetings
- Scores engagement from 0-100 based on multiple signals
- Detects suspicious patterns (tab left open, bot activity, etc.)
- Auto-rejects fraudulent attendance (<30 score)
- Flags low engagement (30-50 score) for manual review

**Metrics tracked:**
- Tab focus time (40% of score)
- Activity rate - mouse/keyboard (25%)
- Audio/video participation (15%)
- Pattern consistency (20%)

### 2. ✅ **Blockchain-Style Immutable Ledger**
**Service**: `backend/src/services/attendanceLedger.ts`

**What it does:**
- Creates tamper-proof attendance records
- Each record is a cryptographic "block" with hash and signature
- Blocks link to previous blocks (blockchain)
- Any tampering is instantly detectable
- Court-ready verification export

**Benefits:**
- Mathematical proof of attendance integrity
- Cannot be modified after creation
- Verifiable chain of custody
- Export for court presentation

### 3. ✅ **Comprehensive Fraud Detection**
**Service**: `backend/src/services/fraudDetection.ts`

**What it does:**
- Runs 12 automated fraud rules
- Categorizes violations by severity (Critical/High/Medium/Low)
- Calculates risk score (0-100)
- Auto-rejects high-risk attendance (80+ score)
- Flags suspicious patterns for review (40-79 score)

**Fraud Rules:**
- Impossible duration
- Zero activity detected
- Bot-like automation patterns
- Duration mismatches
- Low engagement
- Multiple devices
- And 6 more...

### 4. ✅ **Webcam Snapshot Verification** (Optional)
**Service**: `backend/src/services/webcamVerification.ts`

**What it does:**
- Optionally captures periodic webcam hashes
- Privacy-first: NO actual images stored
- Only face detection result (yes/no) + hash
- GDPR compliant
- Auto-deletes after 30 days

**Privacy guarantee:**
- Only stores SHA-256 hashes
- No biometric identification
- No facial recognition
- User consent required
- Can be disabled anytime

### 5. ✅ **Enhanced Frontend Activity Monitor**
**Component**: `frontend/src/components/ActivityMonitor.tsx`

**What it now tracks:**
- Separate mouse and keyboard activity counts
- Tab focus time (milliseconds)
- Device fingerprinting
- Page visibility changes
- Audio/video status (when integrated with Zoom SDK)

**Improved UI:**
- Shows "Tracking Active" when tab focused
- Shows "Active (Background)" when tab not focused
- Shows "Idle Detected" after 2 minutes no activity
- Different colors for each state

## 🔄 How It Works Now

### When a participant leaves a meeting:

```
1. Calculate basic duration
   ↓
2. 🤖 RUN AI ENGAGEMENT ANALYSIS
   - Extract all activity metrics
   - Calculate engagement score
   - Determine level (HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW/SUSPICIOUS)
   - Generate engagement flags
   ↓
3. 🔍 RUN FRAUD DETECTION
   - Check all 12 fraud rules
   - Calculate risk score
   - Collect violations
   - Determine recommendation
   ↓
4. 🔐 CREATE BLOCKCHAIN LEDGER
   - Generate SHA-256 hash
   - Link to previous block hash
   - Create digital signature
   - Store immutably
   ↓
5. 📊 DETERMINE ACTION
   Risk 80+:     AUTO-REJECT (no court card)
   Risk 40-79:   FLAG FOR REVIEW (pending court card)
   Risk <40:     APPROVE (normal court card)
   ↓
6. 📤 SEND ENHANCED RESPONSE
   - Include engagement score
   - Include fraud risk score
   - Include status and flags
   - Include blockchain verification
```
