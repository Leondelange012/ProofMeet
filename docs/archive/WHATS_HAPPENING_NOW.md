## 📊 How to Monitor Deployment

### Railway Dashboard
1. Go to: https://railway.app/dashboard
2. Find your "ProofMeet" or "Backend" project
3. Watch the "Deployments" section
4. You'll see:
   - 🔄 Building...
   - ✅ Build succeeded
   - 🔄 Deploying...
   - ✅ Deploy succeeded

### Vercel Dashboard
1. Go to: https://vercel.com/dashboard
2. Find your ProofMeet frontend project
3. Watch deployment progress

---

## ✅ How to Verify It Worked

### After ~10 Minutes:

**Test 1: Health Check**
```bash
curl https://proofmeet-backend-production.up.railway.app/health
```

**Look for:**
```json
{
  "status": "OK",
  "version": "2.0.0",        ← This means V2.0 is live!
  "system": "Court Compliance"
}
```

**Test 2: Try Registration**
```bash
curl -X POST https://proofmeet-backend-production.up.railway.app/api/auth/register/court-rep \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "email": "your.email@test.proofmeet.com",
    "password": "Test123!",
    "firstName": "Your",
    "lastName": "Name"
  }'
```

**Test 3: Frontend**
Visit: https://proof-meet-frontend.vercel.app
(May still show Phase 1 UI until we update it in Week 2)

---

## 🎯 What to Expect

### Success Scenario:
1. ✅ Railway build completes (~5-10 min)
2. ✅ Health check shows version "2.0.0"
3. ✅ API endpoints respond correctly
4. ✅ Database has V2.0 schema
5. ✅ Test accounts can register/login

### If Something Goes Wrong:
- Check Railway dashboard for build logs
- Look for errors in deployment logs
- Verify environment variables are set
- Check that DATABASE_URL and JWT_SECRET are configured

---

## 📋 After Deployment Succeeds

### Immediate Tasks:

**1. Seed the Database**
```bash
# Go to Railway dashboard
# Click on your backend service
# Go to "Settings" → "Deploy"
# Run command: npm run seed
```

This creates:
- Approved court domains
- Test accounts
- Sample meetings

**2. Test the API**
Use the test script (once backend is live):
```powershell
# You'll need Git Bash or WSL for the .sh script
# Or test manually with curl commands above
```

**3. Verify Database Tables**
- Go to Railway dashboard
- Click PostgreSQL service
- Check that new tables exist:
  - users (with new fields)
  - external_meetings
  - court_cards
  - etc.

---

## 🔍 Quick Status Check

**In 10 minutes, run this:**
```bash
curl https://proofmeet-backend-production.up.railway.app/health
```

**If you see "2.0.0"** → 🎉 **Success! V2.0 is live!**  
**If you see "1.0.0"** → ⏳ Still deploying or deployment failed  
**If error** → 🔧 Check Railway dashboard for logs
