# QR Code 404 Error - FIXED ‚úÖ

## What Was Wrong

The QR codes were pointing to the wrong URL:
- ‚ùå **Wrong**: `https://proofmeet.vercel.app/verify/...` (doesn't exist)
- ‚úÖ **Correct**: `https://proof-meet-frontend.vercel.app/verify/...` (your actual frontend)

The fallback URL in the code was incorrect, causing all QR codes to generate with a non-existent domain.

---

## What I Fixed

**Changed in `backend/src/services/digitalSignatureService.ts`:**

```javascript
// Before:
const baseUrl = process.env.FRONTEND_URL || 'https://proofmeet.vercel.app';

// After:
const baseUrl = process.env.FRONTEND_URL || 'https://proof-meet-frontend.vercel.app';
```

This affects:
- `generateQRCodeData()` - QR code generation
- `generateVerificationUrl()` - Verification links

## What You Need to Do Now (3 Steps)

### Step 1: Wait for Deployment (2-3 minutes) ‚è≥
Railway is deploying the fix right now.

**Check status**: https://railway.app ‚Üí `proofmeet-backend` ‚Üí Wait for üü¢ "Active"

### Step 2: Update QR Codes in Database üîÑ
Once deployment is active:

1. Login to Court Rep dashboard: https://proof-meet-frontend.vercel.app/login
2. Click the **"Update QR Codes"** button (blue button)
3. Confirm when prompted
4. Wait for success message: "Updated X court cards with QR codes"

This will regenerate ALL QR codes with the correct URL.

### Step 3: Test QR Code üì±

1. Download any court card (including today's meeting)
2. Look for:
   - ‚úÖ Card Number: CC-2025-XXXXX-XXX
   - ‚úÖ Verification URL: https://proof-meet-frontend.vercel.app/verify/...
   - ‚úÖ QR Code image (scannable)
3. Scan QR code with phone
4. Should open verification page (no more 404!)

## Why Old Meetings Showed QR Codes But Not Today's

**Old meetings**: 
- Created before today
- When you clicked "Update QR Codes" earlier, they got QR codes (but with wrong URL)
- Showed QR image, but scanning gave 404

**Today's meeting**:
- Created after you clicked "Update QR Codes"  
- Has no QR code data at all yet
- Needs the "Update QR Codes" button clicked again

---

## Verification Page Check

Let me verify the verification route exists:

**Frontend Route**: `/verify/:courtCardId`
- ‚úÖ Should exist in `frontend/src/App.tsx`
- ‚úÖ Component: `VerificationPage.tsx`

**Backend Route**: `/api/verification/card/:courtCardId`
- ‚úÖ Should exist in `backend/src/routes/verification.ts`

If scanning still gives 404 after the update, we may need to check these routes.

## Timeline

- ‚úÖ **0:00** - Fix pushed to GitHub
- ‚è≥ **0:30** - Railway building backend
- ‚è≥ **2:00** - Deployment complete
- üéØ **2:30** - Click "Update QR Codes" button
- ‚úÖ **3:00** - Download and test court card

## Expected Results After Fix

### Court Card PDF Should Show:
```
üì± Instant Verification

Card Number: CC-2025-00333-710
Verification URL: https://proof-meet-frontend.vercel.app/verify/a1b2c3d4-...
Security Hash: 2dbc17c89fee3ca9...

[QR CODE IMAGE HERE]
```

### Scanning QR Code Should:
1. Open: `https://proof-meet-frontend.vercel.app/verify/[uuid]`
2. Show verification page with:
   - Participant details
   - Meeting information
   - Validation status (PASSED/FAILED)
   - Digital signatures
   - Audit trail

### No More:
- ‚ùå 404: NOT FOUND
- ‚ùå Code: 'DEPLOYMENT_NOT_FOUND'
- ‚ùå Wrong URL in QR code

---

## Optional: Set Environment Variable (Recommended)

To prevent this issue in the future, set the environment variable in Railway:

1. Go to: https://railway.app
2. Click `proofmeet-backend`
3. Variables tab
4. Add:
   ```
   FRONTEND_URL=https://proof-meet-frontend.vercel.app
   ```
5. Save (will auto-redeploy)

This way, even if the code fallback changes, the correct URL is always used.

---

## Troubleshooting

### If Still 404 After Update:

**Check Verification Page Exists:**
1. Manually visit: `https://proof-meet-frontend.vercel.app/verify/test`
2. Should show "Court Card not found" (not 404)
3. If 404, the route might be missing

**Check QR Code URL:**
1. Scan QR code
2. Check what URL it opens
3. Should start with: `https://proof-meet-frontend.vercel.app`
4. If not, "Update QR Codes" didn't work

**Force Refresh Database:**
```bash
# In Railway CLI or dashboard
npm run update-qr-codes
```

### If QR Code Image Still Missing:

The URL fix doesn't affect QR image generation. If the image itself is missing:
1. Check that `qrCodeData` field is populated in database
2. May need to regenerate the specific court card
3. Click "Generate Court Cards" button (not just "Update QR Codes")

## Summary

‚úÖ **Fixed**: Changed fallback URL to correct frontend domain  
‚è≥ **Deploying**: Railway building now (~2-3 min)  
üéØ **Next**: Click "Update QR Codes" when deployment is active  
‚úÖ **Result**: QR codes will scan and open verification page  

**Current Status**: Wait for deployment, then test! üöÄ
