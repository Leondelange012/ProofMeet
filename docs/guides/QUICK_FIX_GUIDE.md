# Quick Fix for Missing QR Codes

## The Problem
Court cards created before the QR code feature was added don't have `verificationUrl` or `qrCodeData` populated in the database.

## The Solution
I've added an "Update QR Codes" button that will update ALL existing court cards with QR codes.

## Troubleshooting

### If Button Doesn't Appear:
1. Hard refresh browser: `Ctrl + Shift + R` (Windows) or `Cmd + Shift + R` (Mac)
2. Clear cache and reload

### If Still Shows "N/A":
1. Wait 30 seconds after clicking "Update QR Codes"
2. Click "Refresh" button
3. Try downloading court card again

### If "Update QR Codes" Fails:
1. Check Railway logs for errors
2. Try clicking "Fix Stale Meetings" first
3. Then try "Generate Court Cards"
4. Finally try "Update QR Codes"

### If QR Code Still Not Working After All:
Run this command in Railway CLI or dashboard:
```bash
npm run update-qr-codes
```

## Alternative: Manual Database Fix

If the button doesn't work, you can run the script directly:

**In Railway Dashboard ‚Üí Backend ‚Üí Terminal:**
```bash
npm run update-qr-codes
```

This will update all court cards in the database.

## What Changed

1. **Added new database fields**: `verificationUrl` and `qrCodeData` to `CourtCard` table
2. **Created migration**: To add these fields to production database
3. **Update endpoint**: `POST /api/court-rep/admin/update-qr-codes`
4. **UI Button**: "Update QR Codes" on Court Rep dashboard
5. **CLI Script**: `npm run update-qr-codes` for manual updates
