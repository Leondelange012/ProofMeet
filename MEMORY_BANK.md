# ProofMeet Development Memory Bank

## üö® MAJOR PIVOT - October 7, 2024

### Critical System Redesign in Progress
**ProofMeet is undergoing a fundamental architecture change.**

**Old System (Phase 1):** General meeting management platform where hosts create meetings and participants join.

**New System (Version 2.0):** Specialized court compliance monitoring system where Court Representatives passively monitor participants attending external recovery meetings.

### üìÑ Complete Redesign Documentation

- **Meeting Source**: Changed from "User-created Zoom meetings" to "External API recovery meetings"
- **Workflow**: Changed from "Active meeting management" to "Passive compliance monitoring"
- **Reporting**: Changed from "Manual approval" to "Automatic Court Card generation"
- **Core Value**: Changed from "Meeting coordination" to "Legal proof of attendance"

### Current Status
- ‚úÖ Requirements finalized and documented
- ‚úÖ Week 1 backend implementation COMPLETE
- ‚úÖ 20 API endpoints operational
- ‚úÖ Database schema V2.0 ready
- ‚úÖ Ready for Railway/Vercel deployment
