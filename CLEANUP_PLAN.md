# 🧹 Repository Cleanup Plan

## Files to Delete

### Docker Compose Files (Outdated/Duplicate)
- ❌ `docker-compose.dev.yml` - Old dev config with hardcoded secrets
- ❌ `docker-compose.simple.yml` - Testing artifact without database
- ❌ `docker-compose.working.yml` - Debug artifact for Prisma issues

**Reason:** All superseded by the secure `docker-compose.yml` (updated with env_file)

### Other Cleanup Candidates
- ❌ `.env.bug.txt` - Bug notes file (can be deleted after review)
- ❌ `package-lock.json` (root) - Not needed at root level
- ⚠️ `backend/simple-server.js` - Check if still needed

## Files to KEEP

### Docker Compose
- ✅ `docker-compose.yml` - **MAIN FILE** - Secure, complete setup

### Documentation
- ✅ All `.md` documentation files
- ✅ Railway setup scripts
- ✅ Environment examples

### Environment Files (Local Only - Not in Git)
- ✅ `.env`
- ✅ `backend/.env`
- ✅ `frontend/.env`

## Cleanup Benefits

1. **Security:** Removes files with hardcoded secrets
2. **Clarity:** Only one docker-compose file to maintain
3. **Reduced Confusion:** Clear which file to use
4. **Cleaner Repository:** Less clutter

## Safe to Delete

These files are safe to delete because:
- They were created during development/debugging
- They contain outdated configurations
- They have security issues (hardcoded secrets)
- The main `docker-compose.yml` handles all use cases now
