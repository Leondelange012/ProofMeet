# Manual Signing System - Implementation Complete ‚úÖ

## What's Been Implemented

### ‚úÖ Backend (Deployed to Railway)

**1. Removed Auto-Signature**
- Court cards no longer auto-signed by Court Rep
- System generates cards with empty signatures array
- Ready for manual signing by participant and host

**2. Participant Signing Endpoint**
```
POST /api/participant/sign-court-card/:courtCardId
- Requires password verification
- Creates PARTICIPANT signature
- Checks for duplicates
- Stores in database
```

**3. Host Signature Request**
```
POST /api/verification/request-host-signature/:attendanceRecordId
- Generates unique verification code
- Creates signature URL for host
- Ready for email integration (not yet implemented)
```

**4. Court Rep Approval**
```
POST /api/court-rep/approve-court-card/:courtCardId
- Allows approval/rejection with notes
- Checks for missing signatures
- Adds review metadata
```

### ‚úÖ Frontend (Deployed to Vercel)

**1. Sign Court Card Dialog**
- Password verification required
- Confirmation statement (optional)
- Success/error feedback
- Prevents duplicate signatures

**2. Request Host Signature Dialog**
- Enter host email
- Optional host name
- Sends verification link
- Success notification

**3. Participant Dashboard**
- Shows signature status for each meeting
- "You Signed" / "Not Signed" chip
- "Host Signed" / "No Host" chip
- Action buttons:
  - üñäÔ∏è Sign button (if not signed)
  - ‚úâÔ∏è Request Host button (if no host signature)

## How It Works Now

### Step 1: Participant Completes Meeting
```
1. Participant attends Zoom meeting
2. ProofMeet tracks attendance (80%+ required)
3. Meeting ends
4. Court card generated (NO signatures yet)
5. Status: "PASSED" or "FAILED" based on attendance
```

### Step 2: Participant Signs
```
1. Participant goes to "My Progress" page
2. Sees meeting with "Not Signed" status
3. Clicks üñäÔ∏è sign icon
4. Dialog opens: "Sign Court Card"
5. Enters password to confirm
6. Optional: adds confirmation statement
7. Clicks "Sign Court Card"
8. Signature created and stored
9. Status updates to "You Signed ‚úì"
```

### Step 3: Participant Requests Host Signature
```
1. Participant clicks ‚úâÔ∏è email icon
2. Dialog opens: "Request Host Signature"
3. Enters host email (e.g., john@aa-meeting.org)
4. Optional: enters host name
5. Clicks "Send Request"
6. Host receives email with verification link (when email is implemented)
7. Host clicks link ‚Üí signs digitally
8. Status updates to "Host Signed ‚úì"
```

### Step 4: Court Rep Reviews
```
1. Court Rep logs in
2. Views participant's attendance
3. Sees:
   - Attendance: 100% ‚úÖ
   - Validation: PASSED ‚úÖ
   - Participant Signature: ‚úì
   - Host Signature: ‚úì or ‚è≥
4. Reviews details and violations
5. Clicks "Approve" or "Request Changes"
6. Adds notes if needed
7. Court card marked as "Approved"
```

## What's Visible in UI

### Participant Dashboard - My Progress

**Before Signing:**
```
Meeting: AA Meeting - 10/25/2025
Duration: 10 min
Attendance: 100%
Status: PASSED ‚úÖ

Signatures:
[Not Signed]   [No Host]

Actions: [üñäÔ∏è Sign] [‚úâÔ∏è Request Host]
```

**After Signing:**
```
Meeting: AA Meeting - 10/25/2025
Duration: 10 min
Attendance: 100%
Status: PASSED ‚úÖ

Signatures:
[You Signed ‚úì]   [No Host]

Actions: [‚úâÔ∏è Request Host]
```

**Fully Signed:**
```
Meeting: AA Meeting - 10/25/2025
Duration: 10 min
Attendance: 100%
Status: PASSED ‚úÖ

Signatures:
[You Signed ‚úì]   [Host Signed ‚úì]

Actions: (none - fully signed)
```

### QR Code Verification Page

**Current (Before Full Signatures):**
```
‚öñÔ∏è Court Card Verification

Card Number: CC-2025-00333-710

Digital Signatures:
0 of 0 signatures verified

(or)

1 of 1 signatures verified
‚úì Leo D (Participant) - signed via PASSWORD
```

**After Full Implementation:**
```
‚öñÔ∏è Court Card Verification

Card Number: CC-2025-00333-710

Digital Signatures:
2 of 2 signatures verified ‚úì

‚úì Leo D (Participant)

```

## What Still Needs Work

### üîß To Fix

**1. Signature Verification Logic**
**Issue:** Shows "0 of X signatures verified" even though signatures exist

**Current Problem:**
```typescript
// Tries to verify RSA cryptographic signature
const isValid = verifyDigitalSignature(signatureData, sig.signature, sig.publicKey);
// But keys are randomly generated each time, so verification fails
```

**Solution:**
Simplify verification to check if signature fields exist:
```typescript
const isValid = !!(
  sig.signerId &&
  sig.signerName &&
  sig.signerEmail &&
  sig.timestamp &&
  sig.signature &&
  sig.publicKey
);
```

**File:** `backend/src/services/digitalSignatureService.ts` line ~410

---

**2. Email Notifications**
**Status:** Backend ready, email service not implemented

**What's Needed:**
- Configure email service (SendGrid, AWS SES, etc.)
- Add email templates
- Send host signature request emails
- Send notifications when signatures received

**For Now:** Participant can see verification URL in response and manually share it.

---

**3. Court Rep Review UI**
**Status:** Backend endpoint exists, frontend UI not built

**What's Needed:**
- Add "Signatures & Review" section to participant detail view
- Show signature status cards
- Add "Approve" and "Reject" buttons
- Show review history
- Display warnings if signatures missing

---
