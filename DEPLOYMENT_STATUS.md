## 🔧 If Deployment Fails

### Railway Build Errors

**Check Railway Dashboard:**
1. Go to Railway project
2. Click "Deployments"
3. Click latest deployment
4. View "Build Logs"

**Common Issues:**
- Missing environment variables (DATABASE_URL, JWT_SECRET)
- Build command failed (check package.json)
- TypeScript compilation errors (shouldn't happen!)

**Fix:**
- Add missing environment variables in Railway dashboard
- Verify `package.json` is committed correctly
- Check Railway logs for specific error

---

### Vercel Build Errors

**Check Vercel Dashboard:**
1. Go to Vercel project
2. View deployment logs

**Common Issues:**
- API URL not set (VITE_API_BASE_URL)
- Build command failed

**Fix:**
- Set VITE_API_BASE_URL in Vercel environment variables
- Redeploy from Vercel dashboard

---

## 📋 Post-Deployment Tasks

### Once Backend is Live:

**1. Seed Approved Court Domains**

If you have Railway CLI:
```bash
railway run npm run seed
```

Or manually via Railway dashboard > Run command:
```
npm run seed
```

This creates:
- Approved court domains (CA, TX, NY)
- Test accounts
- Sample external meetings

**2. Verify Database**

Check that tables exist:
- Go to Railway dashboard
- Click on PostgreSQL service
- View tables

Should see:
- `users`
- `external_meetings`
- `attendance_records`
- `court_cards`
- `meeting_requirements`
- etc.

## 🎯 What Should Be Live Now

### Backend API (Railway)
- ✅ https://proofmeet-backend-production.up.railway.app
- ✅ Health check at `/health`
- ✅ API at `/api/auth/*`, `/api/court-rep/*`, `/api/participant/*`

### Frontend (Vercel)
- ✅ https://proof-meet-frontend.vercel.app
- 🔨 May need updates to connect to V2.0 API (Week 2 task)

---

## 📊 Current Deployment Status

**Check these URLs:**

### 1. Backend Health:
```
https://proofmeet-backend-production.up.railway.app/health
```

If this returns `"version": "2.0.0"` → ✅ V2.0 is live!

### 2. Frontend:
```
https://proof-meet-frontend.vercel.app
```

If this loads → ✅ Frontend is deployed

---

## 🎉 Deployment Complete!

Once both services show as "Ready" in their dashboards:

1. ✅ Backend V2.0 is live on Railway
2. ✅ Frontend is live on Vercel  
3. ✅ Database is ready
4. 🔨 Frontend needs updates to use V2.0 API (Week 2)

---

## 🚀 Next Steps

### Immediate:
- Wait for Railway/Vercel deployments to complete (~10 minutes)
- Check health endpoint to verify V2.0 is live
- Seed database with test data

### Week 2:
- Update frontend to use V2.0 auth API
- Build Court Rep dashboard UI
- Build Participant dashboard UI
- Connect all endpoints
